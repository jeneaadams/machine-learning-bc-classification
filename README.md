# An Assessment of Machine Learning Classifiers for Breast Cancer Subtype Prediction
## Jenea Adams, Daniel Hui, Jacob Leiby, Vivek Sriram


Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide and causes over 500,000 deaths per year. Breast cancers can be categorized into immunohistochemistry subtypes based on cell surface proteins. However, IHC subtyping is prone to error. Recent studies have shown that gene expression data from tumors can be used to categorize the subtypes more effectively and consistently. Here, we perform IHC subtype classification with gene expression data from TCGA BRCA cohort using regularized logistic regression, random forests, support vector machines, gradient boosting, and neural networks. We found that L1 regularized logistic regression shows the best performance.
